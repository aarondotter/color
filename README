This directory contains the source code required to generate the color
interpolation subroutines. These library source files are in src/, the
makefile in make/, and a very simple test program in test/.

To compile,

./mk

To clean up,

./clean

To run the test,

./mk
cd test
make
./color_test

You should be prompted to input [Fe/H], logTeff, logg, and log(L/Lo).
If it works properly, you will get back a list of absolute magnitudes
in the Sloan (SDSS) filters.
